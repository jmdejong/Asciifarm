# rooms

This is a multiplayer ascii game (or so far, only the framework for a game actually)

The goal now is to have players walk around in different rooms where they can interact with things.

A lot of functionality is actually working.

IT IS NOW POSSIBLE TO CHANGE ROOMS!!!

## TODO

- improve inventory: probably store it in Player instead of Playerent
- better interaction system
- more content (rooms, objects etc)
- more efficient drawing/communication by only updating changed squares
- write converter to convert tiled map files to readable files
